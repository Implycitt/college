## Prompt
Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?

My freshman year in highschool, I enrolled in my very first computer science class and the first day we were introduced to python. Like many others, my very first line written became, print("Hello, World!"). By the end of my first semester, I was required to create a command line choose your own adventure game in python. The result was, looking back on it, not very impressive. The impact on me, however, was very big; I found a subject that I enjoyed learning about and challenging myself in. Despite not creating functions to output my text, or hard coding every branching narrative instead of using text files, I spent hours after school each day working on the project adding small details or secrets that would reward players that thoroughly explored my game: crawling and colored text, and even a playable snake game within one of the branches. This project exposed me to a new side of STEM that I enjoyed and wanted to pursue.
The next year, I enrolled in AP Computer Science A where we learned about the programming paradigm Object Oriented Programming via Java. Additionally, I joined the school’s computer science club and became very involved attending every meeting I could. I was then introduced to the world of competitive programming and spent a lot of time solving problems with the club. Competitive programming made it clear to me that I enjoyed a challenge and the good feeling you get when solving a hard problem. The satisfaction from the challenge drove me to keep solving more and more problems. Computer science assignments would consume my afternoons as I would try to shorten my code or make it more “readable”.
I enrolled in the last computer science course offered in my highschool in my junior year: AP Computer Science Principles. During this time I participated in the Congressional App Challenge, a nationwide app design contest open to all middle and high schoolers where I submitted a desktop weather application I called “Openmeteo”. I spent a lot of my first semester working on this project and learning new technologies to be able to complete it in time. It also gave me valuable insights on project structure, management, and setting goals. My favorite part about coding is being able to use my own project and seeing a functional final product that presents a solution to a real life problem or shortcoming. I see coding as a means to solve problems such as automating boring tasks, completing a task through software that does not yet exist, or even changing the design or layout of a program to be more efficient or enhance the user experience.
That same year I completed many more projects that ranged from exploring new languages to trying research done on puzzles and problems for myself. My final project for computer science principles was my most recent big project where I decided to push myself and learn a new language for the project. I decided to create a game in rust, a low level language, with a small game engine, from scratch. I faced many hurdles such as learning the syntax of the language, learning a new paradigm for the game engine, understanding fundamentals of game design, and once again managing my time. I chose an ambitious goal for my project so that no matter how far I get to reaching my goal, I would still come out with a good, extensive project. I ended up spending a little over a month on the game and came out a better programmer as a result.
	I intend to continue learning as much as I can, through more projects, harder problems, and more ambitious ideas. Coding has completely shifted my view on my academics and work ethic. It is now always just “one last problem before I get off!”
