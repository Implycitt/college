essay: 
    * ideas: talk about big projects I've worked on in the past:
    - first "big" project with python: text adventure game
    - talk about the exercises where programming clicked and you started to understand the idea behind it all
    - talk about advent of code and the journey through usaco
    - talk about the rust project for csp
    - talk about the recent hackathon

  overall, everything needs to be personal and something that ties into how I spend hours working on programming and WHY it is special to me
