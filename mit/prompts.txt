  3. How did you manage a situation or challenge that you didn’t expect? What did you learn from it?*
  4. No application can meet the needs of every individual. If there is significant information that you were not able to include elsewhere in the application, you may include it here. (Many students will leave this section blank—and that’s okay.)
